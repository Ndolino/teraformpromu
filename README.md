Resource - It is something that we are going to provision/start on AWS.

Now for this article, we are going to provision EC2 instance on AWS.

But before we provision the EC2 instance, we need to gather few points -

ami = you need to tell Terraform which AMI(Amazon Machine Image) you are going to use. Is it going to be Ubuntu, CentOS or something else
instance_type = Also based on your need you have to choose the instance_type and it can be t2.nano, t2.micro, t2. small etc.

3.3 How to find ami(Amazon Machine Image)
To find the correct ami you need to Goto: Services -> EC2

AWS services EC2
In the left Navigation you will find Images -> AMIs

AWS AMIs option in the left navigation
On the search menu click on public images and then type Ubuntu.

AWS access key id and secret access key generated
Copy the AMI ID from the search result.

AWS access key id and secret access key generated

3.4 How to find correct instance_type
You can find the correct Ã¬nstance_type` by visiting this page.

Since I am looking for a very basic instance_type not production level instance, so I choose t2.micro

Here is the aws_instance configuration -

resource "aws_instance" "ec2_example" {
    ami = "ami-0767046d1677be5a0"  
    instance_type = "t2.micro" 
    tags = {
        Name = "Terraform EC2"
    }
}
BASH


4. terraform commands
Alright, now we have completed all the pre-requisites for provisioning our first ec2 instance on the AWS.


4.1 terraform plan
The first command which we are going to run is -

terraform init 
BASH
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing the previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Installing hashicorp/aws v3.32.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v3.32.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary 
BASH
The terraform init command is responsible for downloading all the dependencies which are required for the provider AWS.

Once you issue the terraform init command it will download all the provider's dependencies on your local machine.


4.2 terraform plan
This command will help you to understand how many resources you are gonna add or delete.

Here is the command -

terraform plan 
BASH
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.ec2_example will be created
  + resource "aws_instance" "ec2_example" {
      + ami                          = "ami-0767046d1677be5a0"

    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run. 
...
BASH
As you can see the output of terraform plan, at the end it will show all the resources added and deleted.

**(Note:- This command is not going to provision start your t2.micro instance)**


4.3 terraform apply
This command will do some real stuff on AWS. Once you will issue this command, it will be going to connect to AWS and then finally going to provision AWS instance.

Here is the command -

terraform apply 
BASH
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.ec2_example: Creating...
aws_instance.ec2_example: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.ec2_example: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
aws_instance.ec2_example: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
aws_instance.ec2_example: Creation complete after 33s [id=i-0a948ac635a2010f1]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. 
BASH
As you can see the log output has created t2.micro instance.


4.4 Verify the EC2 setup
Let's verify the setup by going back to AWS console.

Goto -> Services -> EC2 you should see 1 instance running.


AWS ec2 running instance

AWS ec2 running instance with more details
You can also see the Tag name - Terraform EC2 which we mentioned in the terraform script.


4.4 terraform destroy
Now we have seen how to write your terraform script and how to provision your EC2 instance.

Let see how to remove or delete everything from AWS.

We are going to use the command -

terraform destroy 
BASH
Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.ec2_example: Destroying... [id=i-0a948ac635a2010f1]
aws_instance.ec2_example: Still destroying... [id=i-0a948ac635a2010f1, 10s elapsed]
aws_instance.ec2_example: Still destroying... [id=i-0a948ac635a2010f1, 20s elapsed]
aws_instance.ec2_example: Still destroying... [id=i-0a948ac635a2010f1, 30s elapsed]
aws_instance.ec2_example: Still destroying... [id=i-0a948ac635a2010f1, 40s elapsed]
aws_instance.ec2_example: Destruction complete after 40s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed. 
BASH
It will remove all the running EC2 Instances.
